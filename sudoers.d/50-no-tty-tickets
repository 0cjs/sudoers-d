# By default the "ticket" you get from sudo lets you sudo again
# without a password for the `timestamp_timeout` period, but only on
# that one terminal or window.
#
# Disabling `tty_tickets` means that an authentication on any terminal
# allows you to use sudo without a password on any terminal during
# that period. (Obviously, this is only useful if a password is
# required to sudo in the first place.)
#
# The typical cases where this is useful are:
#   1. When administering a host over a network (e.g., via ssh) you
#      connect multiple times (getting a new pty with each connection)
#      and you can't or don't want to re-type your sudo password each
#      time.
#   2. You're running X11 and want authentication to be valid for all
#      windows, not just the one in which you authenticated.
#
# In general, if you're paranoid enough that you use a pasword to sudo
# in the first place, you probably don't want this, but it can be
# essential in certain remote administration situations (point 1
# above) where you're using a tool such as Ansible that cannot give a
# password to sudo. In that case you can `ssh -t somehost sudo -v`,
# type the password, and then run Ansible; when it logs in and tries
# to sudo it will be able to do so without having your password.
