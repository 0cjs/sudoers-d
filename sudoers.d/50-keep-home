# Maintain user's $HOME variable when they sudo.
#
# Note that this is a bad idea for users not given unrestricted root
# access since it allows them to change settings of programs that read
# their configuration from files in $HOME. Thus, we restrict this to
# users in groups (`wheel` on CentOS, `sudo` on Debian) that normally
# are given unrestricted root access. (These groups may be different on
# your system.)
#
# For unrestricted users, using their own $HOME is not only more
# convenient (as they get their own aliases and program configurations)
# but also safer since it helps avoid unexpected behaviour, committing
# changes under the wrong name, and so forth.
#
# If you need to use the target's home directory as $HOME or the
# target's environment, you can add the `-H` or `-i` option when you
# sudo.

# Handy for those who use Vagrant or Kitchen for testing, since the
# vagrant user is not added to the wheel/sudo groups.
